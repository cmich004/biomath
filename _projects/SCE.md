# Subcellular Element model
## of growth of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) of Arabidopsis thaliana
This software simulates combined growth of the L1, L2, and deeper L3 layers of the SAM where individual cells are represented as collections of nodes representing subcellular components of cells.

The program creates the following files:

* Animate is a folder that contains .vtk files for viewing simulations in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).
* Nematic is a folder that contains individual information for each cell including, cell center and the main axis of elongation of each cell.  

  The code is available from [gitHub](https://github.com/mikahlbk/ScePlantCells_Parallel).
